Project Overview: This project is a Manual Software Testing project conducted in a team-based environment (2–3 members per team).
The objective is to apply the complete Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) on the OrangeHRM application, starting from requirements analysis to test summary reporting.

The project focuses on functional testing based on an official Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

Software Requirements Specification (SRS): All testing activities in this project are derived from the official SRS document.

______________________________
Team Setup:

Students are divided into teams of 2–3 members

Tasks and user stories are distributed among team members

Collaboration and progress tracking are managed using Trello
______________________________

Testing Phases (STLC):
Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
* Study and understand the SRS document

* Identify functional requirements and system behavior

* Create a Trello board named: “OrangeHRM – Functional Testing”

* Board columns:TO DO, In Progress, Blocked, Testing, Done
______________________________
Phase 2: Test Plan

* Define testing scope, approach, and objectives

* Identify features to be tested based on SRS

* Break down requirements into user stories

* Create Trello cards for each requirement

* Assign cards to team members
______________________________

Phase 3: Test Case Design

* Design detailed manual test cases for assigned user stories

* Include: Positive test cases, Negative test cases

* Follow a structured test case template

* Test cases are documented using Google Sheets / Excel
______________________________

Phase 4: Test Execution

* Execute test cases on the OrangeHRM application

* Mark test cases as: Passed, Failed, Blocked

* Log defects with clear steps, expected vs actual results

* Deliverables:

  Bug Report (PDF, if defects are found)

  RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix)
______________________________

Phase 5: Test Summary

* Prepare a Test Summary Report

* Include:

    Total test cases

    Passed, failed, skipped test cases

    Overall testing status
